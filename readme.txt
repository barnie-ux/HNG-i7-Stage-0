When I got informed about the task to get into Stage 1, I was a bit confused and scared. What does a graphical user interface designer have to do with Git and Github?

But I had no choice right? I had to do it. So I went to learn.

And frankly speaking, I'm glad I did!

Now I know the power of Github. Not just as a collaborative tool... but also as a safe house for me.

Had to learn a couple of strange words and terms like command lines, repository, branch etc.

Now I can create files and folders (directories), delete files, navigate through folders, create a local git repo, commit files and other cool from my computer terminal.

Infact! This post is on my first github repository!



If just from the first task, I got to learn all of these, then I'm really anticipating all the challenges awaiting me.

I know its going to be fun.
